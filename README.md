# learn-cicd-starter (Notely)

This repo contains the starter code for the "Notely" application for the "Learn CICD" course on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

## Local Development

Make sure you're on Go version 1.20 or above.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with this following content:

```bash
PORT="8000"
```

Run the server:

```bash
go build -o notely && ./notely
```

*This starts the server in non-database mode.* It will serve a simple webpage at `http://localhost:8000`.

You do *not* need to set up a db or any interactivity on the webpage quite yet. Instructions for that will come later on in the course!
